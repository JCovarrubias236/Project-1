Code Crusaders - Music Trends Through the Generations

**Background**
Music has been around in various forms for many many years, with some forms even dating back to over 35,000 years ago. Throughout time, music has been used within religions, to celebrate, to share messages, to inspire, to express oneself, and to generally entertain. Across the decades, how music is created, shared, consumed, and utilized has evolved rapidly and innovatively. 
Since the start of the new millenia, music consumption has been digitized and consumers are now more likely to consume music via streaming than in previous generations’ where consumption was via physical or analog mediums. 

Depending on what (recent) generation you may have been born in, the consumption, listening habits, and popularity of genres or music types may differ. Our team was interested in analyzing music trends of the past to determine if its possible to predict the trends of the next generation to come. 

**Objective**
In order to analyze streaming data to better understand music trends across listening generations*, we will utilize data from one of the top music streaming companies in the world, Spotify. This data was retrieved via Spotify’s API as well as a Kaggle dataset of Spotify songs with different genres and their audio features**. 

Once our data has been cleaned and merged, we were able to do initial data exploration based on our objectives. Our objectives aimed to lead us to the overarching question of “Based on listening trends of the past, is it possible to determine what will be popular in the next generation ( Generation Beta)”

Code Crusaders’ Objectives
- How has the number of tracks (songs) changed over time, specifically across each generation.
- Understand how have features of tracks evolved over time? What features seem to be the most common in each listening generation.
- Determine how genres have evolved and if there are consistent genres that stand the test of time.
